# Smackdown_v1.0

Smackdown is an Ethereum dApp that allows golfers to bet ETH on a nassau match. Golfers deposit ETH into the contract prior to the start of their match. On completion of their round, they post their scores to the dApp (eth.andrewnagata.com). Once all the players have posted, the smart contract determines the winner(s) and distributes the ETH accordingly.

The contracts here are not intended to be used on mainnet. They gas consumption is outrageous. This was an initial attempt to understand how web3 will impact user experience, and discover what it might be like using the blockchain in everyday applications. Perhaps, if deployed on Polygon, or another scaling chain, the fees would be manageable.
